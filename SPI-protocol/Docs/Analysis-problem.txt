Requirement
	Driver communicate ZynQ 7000 to DSP TMS320C5509A
	Use McBSP port
Objects
	How about ZynQ 7000 ?
	How about DSP TMS320C5509A?
	What's McBSP?

How about ZynQ 7000 ?
	Is the SoC integrate of ARM and FPGA
	Can use with Linux and Free RTOS
	2 x UART
	2 x CAN 2.0B
	2 x I2C
	2 x SPI
	4 x GPIO
How about DSP TMS320C5509A?
	Is the DSP
	Manufactured by TI
	Up to 3 Multichannel Buffered Serial Ports (McBSPs) 
What's McBSP?
	Mulitichannel Buffered Serial Port
	Standard protocol
	The primary use for the McBSP is for audio interface purposes
	The McBSP consists of a data path and a control path that connect to external devices.
	Separate pins for transmission and reception communicate data to these external devices.
McBSP signals
		clock transmit - CLKX
		clock receive- CLKR
		frame sync transmit - FSX
		frame sync receive - FSR
		Data transmit - DX
		Data receive - DR
How to comminicate between both devices?
		Mcbsp connect with spi
McBSP as SPI Slave
McBSP as SPI Master
Solution
	McBSP as SPI Slave
	Target: Write SPI driver on ZynQ to communicate with DSP
