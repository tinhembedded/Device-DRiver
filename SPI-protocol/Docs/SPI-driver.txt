Introduction to SPI
	What's SPI?
	Common uses of SPI
	SPI signals 
	SPI Modes 

What's SPI?
	Serial Peripheral Interface 
	4 wires signals
	Motorola design
	Master - Slave
	no maximum clock speed
Common uses of SPI
	Flash memory
	ADCs
	LCD controllers
	Sensors
SPI signals 
SPI Modes 

SPI concepts on Linux
	SPI protocol driver
	SPI controller driver
	spidev

SPIDEV
	Idea
		Simplest for development and test
	Enable spidev
	drivers/spi/spidev.c

SPI protocol driver
	Idea: Support functions with special device
	struct spi_driver
	spi.h
Implement
	Device tree SPI child node
	Instance of SPI device and corresponding APIs
Device tree SPI child node
Instance of SPI device
	struct spi_device
	spi_device_id
	of_device_id
APIs use for SPI protocol driver
	#include <linux/spi.h>
	spi_setup()
	spi_write()
	spi_read()
	spi_w8r8 - SPI synchronous 8 bit write followed by 8 bit read
	spi_w8r16 - SPI synchronous 8 bit write followed by 16 bit read

SPI Controller
	Idea: Configuration registers of SPI module
	struct platform_driver
Implement
	Device tree SPI node
	Instance of SPI device and corresponding APIs
Device tree
Instance of SPI driver
	struct spi_master
	struct spi_controller
APIs
	spi_alloc_master()
	omap2_mcspi_master_setup()
	spi_master_put()
	spi_register_master - register SPI master controller
	spi_unregister_controller() - unregister SPI master or slave controller
